#MPG Regression
##Question: Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
##Answer: vehicle length / ground clearance provide a non-random amount of vairance to the mpg values in the dataset.
##Script:
###summary(lm(mpg~`vehicle length`+`vehicle weight`+`spoiler angle`+`ground clearance`+`AWD`,MechaCarTable))
##Result

### Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
### Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
### F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11


##Question: Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
##Answer:p-value of the hypothisis: 5.35e-11. which is smaller then 0.05 significant level
##and hence it is not zero


##Question: Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
##Answer: I used r-squared value = 71% so it is above 50% correct prediction. Yes it can. Overall prediction if more then 50% and near to 100% ##then it is correct

##Suspension Coil Summary
##Question: coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.Does the current manufacturing data meet ##this design specification? Why or why not?
##Answer: If we go by complete dataset provided the varianace is 62 which is lower then 100 pounds per inch. But when we go by manufacting lots, ##it says lot3 has more then 100 variance where as lot1 and lot2 are below 10.So the current manufacturing data for lot3 does not meet the ##design specifications.

##Script
###suspenstionCoilTable <- read.csv(file='Suspension_Coil.csv',check.names=F,stringsAsFactors = F)
###SuspensionCoilByLot <- suspenstionCoilTable %>% group_by(Manufacturing_Lot) %>%
###  summarise(Mean=mean(PSI),Median=median(PSI),Variance=var(PSI),SD=sd(PSI))
###print(SuspensionCoilByLot)

### Manufacturing_Lot  Mean Median Variance     SD

### 2 Lot2              1500.  1500     7.47   2.73 
### 3 Lot3              1496.  1498.  170.    13.0  

###SuspensionCoilSummary <- suspenstionCoilTable %>% 
###  summarise(Mean=mean(PSI),Median=median(PSI),Variance=var(PSI),SD=sd(PSI))
###print(SuspensionCoilSummary)
### Mean Median Variance       SD
### 1 1498.78   1500 62.29356 7.892627

##Question: Using the same suspension coil data and the MechaCarChallenge.RScript file, determine if the suspension coils pound-per-inch results ##are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. (Hint: Refer to the t-test section of this module to ##determine which statistical test #to use.)
##Answer: p value is 2.2e-16 which is less then .05 significance level and hence we can reject our null  hypothesis: true mean is not equal to ##1500. This is also true for each lot level samples

##RScript:
###lot1 <- filter(suspenstionCoilTable, Manufacturing_Lot == "Lot1")
###lot2 <- filter(suspenstionCoilTable, Manufacturing_Lot == "Lot2")
###lot3 <- filter(suspenstionCoilTable, Manufacturing_Lot == "Lot3")
###t.test(log10(lot1$PSI),mu=1500)
###t.test(log10(lot2$PSI),mu=1500)
###t.test(log10(lot3$PSI),mu=1500)
###t.test(log10(suspenstionCoilTable$PSI),mu=1500)

##Result:
### One Sample t-test
### 
### data:  log10(suspenstionCoilTable$PSI)
### t = -7978095, df = 149, p-value < 2.2e-16
### alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
### 95 percent confidence interval:
###   3.175361 3.176103
### sample estimates:
###   mean of x 
### 3.175732 


#Design your study
##Question: Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).
##Answer: Going further with car performance few other data points that can be analysed would be Horse power, Number of cylinders. These will be ##inversely related more horse power or number of cylinders will give less mgp.

##Question: Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, 
##and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.
###Hyphothesis (1): There are statistical difference in the horsepower of a vehicle based on number of cylinders
###Null Hypothesis (1): There is no difference in HP based on the number of cylinders
###For above Anova test should be used at the summary level

###Hypothesis (2): The higher horse power of the vehicle will give lower miles per gallon for that vehicle
###Null Hypothesis (2): The higher horse power is not related to mpg for the vehicle
###Hypothesis (3): The higher number of cylinders of the vehicle will give lower miles per gallon for that vehicle
###Null Hypothesis(4): Bigger engine size is not related to mpg for the vehicle
###Use: One sample t-test

###Question: Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?
###When using the ANOVA formula statement, each independent variable will be shown as a separate row, with an additional “Residuals” row that ###tells us what the residual error is for our ANOVA model. 
###For our purposes, we are only concerned with the “Pr(>F)” column, which is the same as our p-value statistic.
###For t-test, depending on how small our p-value is, there may be symbols on the right side that indicate which significance level the p-value is below. 
###p value: probability of selecting a sample with a mean value less than or equal to this one would be approximately p value %
###confidence interval: tells us that many percent will achieve Inf : unit
###mean: Show mean for the sample population
